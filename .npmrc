# Security best practices for npm
# 
# Disable install scripts by default for security
# Install scripts can execute arbitrary code during package installation, which is a security risk.
# If a package legitimately requires install scripts (e.g., native modules), you can:
#   1. Enable scripts temporarily: npm install --ignore-scripts=false <package>
#   2. Or enable globally for one install: npm install --ignore-scripts=false
#   3. Or add to .npmrc temporarily: ignore-scripts=false (then revert after install)
ignore-scripts=true

# Enable audit to check for vulnerabilities
audit=true

# Set audit level to high (high, critical)
# This ensures we catch high and above vulnerabilities
audit-level=high

# Enforce strict SSL verification
strict-ssl=true

# Use exact versions in package.json (optional but recommended for security)
# This prevents automatic minor/patch updates that might introduce vulnerabilities
# save-exact=true

# Ensure package-lock.json is always used
package-lock=true

# Use npm's public registry (explicit for clarity)
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Disable fund messages (optional, reduces noise)
fund=false

# Disable update notifications (optional, reduces noise)
update-notifier=false
